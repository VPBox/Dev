/// For loading via a file, the following steps will be taken:
/// 1. The loader sends a LoadNanoappRequest message to CHRE. app_binary must
///    be set for legacy purposes, but should be empty. Additionally,
///    fragment_id and total_app_size are unused in this request. The loading
///    that happens as part of this request is serialized, but asynchronous
///    meaning that load requests will be processed in the order they are sent
///    but multiple requests can be outstanding at any given time.
/// 2. CHRE stores the filename and waits until its event loop is able to
///    process the request.
/// 3. Once ready, the nanoapp will be loaded from the file specified in the
///    original request and will send a callback indicating the
///    completion/failure of the request.
/// For loading via a buffer, loading may optionally be fragmented into multiple
/// sequential requests, which will follow the following steps:
/// 1. The loader sends a LoadNanoappRequest message to CHRE. If the request
///    is fragmented, then the fields fragment_id and total_app_size must
///    be defined. Once the first fragment is sent to CHRE, all subsequent
///    fragments must be delivered before a new LoadNanoappRequest can be
///    issued. If a new request is received while a current request has
///    outstanding fragments, the current request will be overridden with the
///    new one.
/// 2. CHRE preallocates the required amount of memory, and loads app_binary,
///    appending to already loaded fragments as appropriate.
/// 3. If the request is fragmented, then the requestor must sequentially send
///    multiple LoadNanoappRequest with incremental nanoapp binary fragments.
///    CHRE will respond with LoadNanoappResponse for each request. For
///    requests starting from the second fragment, all fields except
///    fragment_id and app_binary should be ignored by CHRE.
///
///    Once the LoadNanoappRepsonse for the last fragment is received
///    by the HAL, the HAL client will receive a callback indicating the
///    completion/failure of a load request.
///
/// If any request fragment is lost, then the entire load request will be
/// considered to have failed. If the request times out (e.g. the requestor
/// process crashes), then the load request will be cancelled at CHRE and fail.
